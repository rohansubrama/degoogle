<h3>Why denounce Google Chrome?</h3> 
<p> Since 2012, Google Chrome has been the most popular browser in the world. Then why denounce it? Google Chrome has consistently proved to be the worst browser for privacy. Here are a few reasons why 
    (click on each reason to expand accordion)- 
      </p>

<!--ACCORDION-->

<section class="accordian" role="tablist" aria-live="polite">

         <h3>1. Google and Google Chrome is not 'free'</h3>
     </span>
     <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel0" aria-labelledby="tab0" role="tabpanel">
         <p>Millions of users find Google Chrome appealing since it is free to use and integrate with other
            free Google products. Google Search doesn't cost anything. Users can make a free Gmail account and make use of the free
            15 GB of Google Drive storage, while syncing data, browser tabs and profiles on their Google Account.
            So what is Google's business model? How does it generate revenue enough to be the biggest tech company
            in the world? Google derives payment from its users in the form of their information, that is then used
            to train machine-learning algorithms and monetize on that information by sharing it with third parties and advertizers.
            Information is currency and Google Chrome violates the informed consent by hiding its data collection
            practices within its privacy policy. Its not opt-in, it is Google services.</p>
     </div>
     <span id="tab1" tabindex="1" class="section-title" aria-controls="panel1" role="tab">
        <h3>2. How does Chrome collect user data?</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel1" aria-labelledby="tab1" role="tabpanel">
        <p>From Google's privacy policy- "The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, 
            device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, 
            and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices 
            with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request." 
            Additionally, Google collects information on the activity of users interacting with their services including: </p>
            <p class="indent">  
            Terms you search for <br>
                Videos you watch <br>

        <h3>3. Who is tracking your activity on Google Chrome?</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel2" aria-labelledby="tab2" role="tabpanel">
        <p>To say the least this is nuanced and contextual. When using a browser that doesn't encrypt, proxy or mask your IP adress, 
            your ISP and network manager will almost always be able to see what websites have been logged on the network. Certain browsers like 
            Tor and Brave (with VPN) can help with that. However, the conversation becomes troubling when the browser company itself, the 
            search enginge you visit and every single website you access on the internet, is able to track your information. 
            Chrome is a guilty party on many fronts, harvesting data on browser history, search history, and personal information to build a 
            user 'profile' which it can leverage to help advertisers use targeted ads. It also shares aggregate data directly 
            with advertisers in a bidding system. Moreover, it has very low stakes in protecting other websites from tracking user data, including
            third-party invisible trackers, advertisement trackers, IP address trackers, fingerprinting trackers. 
            In essence, when using Chrome, user information is more public than ever. And this is before a data leak. 
              </p>
    </div>
    <span id="tab3" tabindex="3" class="section-title" aria-controls="panel3" role="tab">
        <h3>4. Chrome's functionality is lacking</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel3" aria-labelledby="tab3" role="tabpanel">
        <p>Chrome is a RAM guzzler. It utilizes more system memory than most other browsers because of it's singular-tab/task singular-processing model and
            due to its pre-rendering predictive processing. Chrome also has some controversial feature-updates in the recent years. 
            In 2022, Chrome announced moving towards Manifest V3 API, which renders most ad-blocking plugins useless. In response, 
            FireFox, Arc, Brave and other brwosers have maintained functionality of Manifest V2 that still allows popular extensions
            like uBlock Origint to retain functionality. In the past 4 years, Chrome faced a major lawsuit wherein it was revealed that 
            Chrome was still collecting the same data even when users were operating within Incognito mode. So, under the pretense of privacy
            Chrome was able to use potentially embarassing searches on Incognito to monetize personal ad targeting even further.

 <h2>Arc</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">

    It doesn't collect data on which websites you visit, searches you make and doesn't 
    sell any data to third-parties. It comes with Google as the search engine
    default, but it is very easy to switch to some alternatives like DuckDuckGo.</p>
    <img class="browserlogo" id="ARC" src="./00_arc.jpg">
 </div>
    <p class="normal">In the ranking below, Arc scores a 2 in privacy because of its questionable protection against 
        fingerprinting, essentially presenting a singular fingerprint identity to different websites making it easier to track the user
        over time. It's unbearable push for integrating Open AI 
    features is also concerning, wherein your personal data is sent to Open AI for syntehsis, and Arc doesn't have control over 
    how Open AI stores or uses your data in the future. You can find Arc's privacy <a href="https://arc.net/privacy#under-what-conditions-would-we-share-your-personal-data">policy</a>

        state, blocks third-party ads and trackers. Brave also has a VPN and Firewall that adds further no-tracking protection. It will also
        inform users of how many ads and trackers it is blocking each day. 
    </p>
    <img class="browserlogo" id="BRAVE" src="./00_brave.png">
 </div>
    <p class="normal">Brave lands a close to perfect score in privacy, allowing users to browser the internet with the option 
        of a VPN and firewall. User IP Address is protected from tracking consistently along with encryption of user data 
        to allow further protection. It's also a very fast browser, loading 3x faster than Google Chrome. Brave also has some 
        excellent features like a video-calling feature right through the browser, vertical tabs and grouping like Arc, Rewards and program using 
        Brave Wallet and it's own search engine that is privacy personified. It is, overall, one of the best options if privacy 
        and usability is the concern. The downside of Brave, like Arc, is its built from Chromium which never really frees itself from Google tracking. <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-features/" >Privacy Policy.</a></p>

        bookmarking feature and disabled syncing between devices. Because of features being disabled to enhance security, 
        certain websites might break when viewing them on LibreWolf. Librewolf is modifiable by the user to develop
        custom versions of the browser. This requires extensive knowledge of browser systems and has a technical barrier.

 <section id="section4">
 <h2>Tor</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">
    <p class="squish">Tor Browser is a subset of the Tor Onion Project and is meant to be used with the Tor network.
        Tor Network works by sending user traffick through three random 'tunnels' or 'relays'in the Network. The last 
        tunnel the traffick comes out of sends it into the public internet. With the use of the Tor network, user's ISP or
        any tracker on the internet will not be able to monitor user activity, including names and websites visited. 
        Additionally, user ISP will remain private and secure since the traffick will be identified as coming from the 
        Tor Network.
    </p>
    <img class="browserlogo" id="TOR"src="./00_tor.png">
 </div>
     <p class="normal">The Tor Network and the Tor browser are lauded for their private, secure and open-internet access.
        It is important, however, to recognize that the Tor browser is a means to accessing the Dark Web. Even if a user is accessing
        websites and chatrooms that are not on the surface internet, it is important to maintain ananymity by using psuedonyms and aliases.
        Usage of the the Tor Network has connotations attached to it, and those who recognize user presence on the Network might have
        speculative interests in pursuing your identity. Only user's with the capability of using Tor should be using.

 <h2>GNU IceCat</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">
    <p class="squish">GNU IceCat is a completely free version of the Mozilla FireFox browser. This sounds incorrect 
        since FireFox is also free to use. However, while the source code of FireFox is free, they recommend nonfree extensions, 
        plug-ins and addons. GNU circumvents these non-free hidden tactics that allow these plugins and add-ons to track information
        or collect data as their business model. GNU IceCat blocks and redirects non-free JavaScript plugins that are potentially
        dangerous, it avoids fingerprinting and spoofs locational data, and prevents connections to third-parties.

        that if privacy is connected to personal security of an individual, GNU IceCat is not a replacement for the Tor
