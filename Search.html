<div class="reason"> 
<h3>Why does Google Search suck?</h3> 
<p> Google Search has a 92% share of the global search engine market. Quite literally, it is a monopoly on information 
    discovery. However, contrary from popular notions, Google isn't a public information search engine, it's a <strong>for-profit</strong> ad agency. 
    Moreover, it is invested in the insidious practice of monetizing user information. Here are just a few reasons why 
    Google Search sucks. (click on each reason to expand accordion)- 
      </p>

         <h3>1. Google Search is a monopoly.</h3>
     </span>
     <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel0" aria-labelledby="tab0" role="tabpanel">
         <p>Google has 89% share of the Search market for desktop browsing and about 94% for mobile, aggregating to 
            92% overall marketshare. This marketshare is the result of years of anti-competitive practices from Google
            and monetizing user information to make Search an advertiser friendly and profitable platform. Google, pays millions 
            of dollars to smartphone and technology manufactures, reaching up to 26 million dollars in 2021. This practice, 
            over the years has ensured that Google is viewed as the default, as the norm. It's solidified itself so thoroughly as 
            as a search engine, 'googling' has become synonymous with searching on the internet. It's business model is terrifyingly
            effective in retaining advertisers and therefore commercial-political backing. With the treasure trove of information Google has on its users, it can bridge advertisers to certain demographics very effectively, 
            ensuring that company ad's target the most likely individuals to be enticed by the advertisement. This business model 
            and the global reach of Google, ensures that companies and corporate entities, with power and influence, lobby for Google relentlessly.

     <span id="tab1" tabindex="1" class="section-title" aria-controls="panel1" role="tab">
        <h3>2. How user data gets collected.</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel1" aria-labelledby="tab1" role="tabpanel">
        <p>Google Search is an advertisement delivery mechanism that is presupposed on the vast amounts of information
            that Google collects on its users. When using Google's search engine, all keyword searches, websites visited after searching,
            search history information is collected and associated to the user. This problem becomes more insidious when a user is signed into
            their Google account and information from other Google services like Gmail, GDrive, Chrome, Google Pay etc. are then further attributed to the user
            in conjuction with search data. Google also tracks locational data when search queries trigger the use of location services. Google builds a profile of its users, which includes personal, locational and demographic information along
            with likes, dislikes, interests and activity engagement. For advertisers, than the Topic API algorithm associates advertisements in association to the 
            very specific 'topic' that the user is interested in and delivers them to the user. These topics are often so niche and consistent with the user's 
            interests that it incites engagement with the advertisement. Google charges the advertiser based on engagement with the ad. So, user information 
            is monetized in a manner that ads are targetting the user, leading to Google making more money and advertizers selling more products. </p>
          
    </div>
    <span id="tab2" tabindex="2" class="section-title" aria-controls="panel2" role="tab">
        <h3>3. Google Search is racist and sexist</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel2" aria-labelledby="tab2" role="tabpanel">
        <p> Algorithmic biases in search indexing and search results might not be solely a Google problem. But, considering that Google holds a monopoly on Search, 
            it is inherently a google problem. Algorithmic biases exists because Search is pre-supposed on the biases of the humans that make the machine-learning indexing algorithms.
            Machine-learning is not a computer acting on its own, it is taking the code written by humans, the stereotypes and notions of those humans, when associating keywords
            to search results. As a result, Google search inherently depicts White perspectives. 
            This problem becomes more troubling when taking into account the algorithms collecting information on its users and attributing users to 'topic groups' 
            as per the Google Topics API or the use of FloC, wherein stereotypical attribution of users to targeted ads becomes commonplace. 
              </p>

    <span id="tab3" tabindex="3" class="section-title" aria-controls="panel3" role="tab">
        <h3>4. Google Search is inaccurate, spammy, laiden with AI</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel3" aria-labelledby="tab3" role="tabpanel">
        <p> Google Search is increasingly using AI features to deliver faster results to its users. One example is the 'AI Overview'
            at the top of every search result, that attempts to coalate factual information using AI large language models. A dozen or so 
            researchers have discovered that a lot of this information is not accurate and delivers false information to unsuspecting users. 
            Additioanlly, the push for advertisement/sponsor content delivery during Search results leads to less appropriate and 
            less useful information being delivered to users at the top of their search results. Many users on the interent have recognized the
            deterioriation of search results within the past 10 years, leading to inaccurate, spammy and ad-driven webpages, rather than information 
            that users are actually looking for. Again, Google is not a public-information indexing engine, it's an advertisement company.

 <h2>DuckDuckGo</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">
    <p class="squish">DuckDuckGo is a privacy focused search engine that was launched in 2008, after a recognition 
        for a need for a search engine that protects the privacy of their users. It doesn't track its users. It doesn't collect location
        data of its users even if location services are required by third-party services. It protects from third-party tracking, 
        third-party cookies, device fingerprint protection from third-party trackers, link tracking removal, and services do-not-track requests.
        It downranks websites that have said to have low journalistic quality and resists content-mills and filters pages with advertising.
        DuckDuckGo Search results are compiled from over 400 sources including Bing, Yahoo!, Wolfram Alpha, Yandex and its own webcrawler - DuckDuckBot.
        It doesn't use Google in its search results.

 <section id="section2">
 <h2>Startpage</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">
    <p class="squish">Startpage is a privacy-focused search engine that prioritizes not saving, sharing or selling search data.
        It provides un-profiled search results and doesn't allow third-party trackers and cookies. 'Anonymous View' provides
        an actual private browsing experience, unlike Google's Incognito mode. It also prevent price-tracking of its users, ensuring that third parties
        are unable to target ads. Startpage does use search results from Google, but re-indexes with privacy focused features. However, 
        since it does pay for using Google results, it's not considered true de-googling. It is a good Google alternative especially if a user 
        is used to Google searches but would want the next step to privacy for themselves.

 <h2>Ecosia</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">
    <p class="squish">Ecosia is a sustainability-driven search engine. It uses renewable resources 
        like solar energy to power the servers that structure the engine. It emphasizes that it does not use third-party tracking 
        or build a profile of its users to deliver ads. It uses search results from Bing and more recently from Google. 
        It delivers some ads from Bing in a profit-sharing agreement, but these ads are not targeted and are not structured on user-information for delivery and 
    attribution to user. Ecosia is a great engine alternative to Google for the more eco-cautious users. 100% of Ecosia's profits are dedicated towards tree-planting projects.
    It is also very transparent with its earning and its contributions to the environement, ensuring trust in the organization. It is not the most privacy-focused search engine, however
and still collects user IP address, search terms and session behavioral data. Additioanlly, when using Google Search, it allows Google to attribute third-party cookies to the user. 
Ecosia does not target ads, and is a good starting point to switch from Google. Users can also choose to use search results from Bing, if they'd like to 
move away from Google altogether.</p>

 <section id="section4">
 <h2>Kagi</h2>
 <div class="contentcontainer">
    <p class="squish">
        Kagi is the only paid search engine on this list, well-worth the product. Kagi provides excellent reasons why 
        its a paid product, claiming that Google makes about $277 per year on a single user's search, or about $23 per month for someone 
        to influence user's search results. As per their explanation 'User attention is being auctioned off to the highest bidder'. In comparison, 
        Kagi aims to charge its users an affordable fee per month to provide results that are not influenced by advertisements in the least. It's
        user-centric search focuses on anonymous search queries, no data retention and relavant search results. As a first, Kagi also offers a way for users
        to rank pages according to their personal usability, thus allowing users to make a personal page-rank system that woudl improve the accuracy of search results desired.
        Kagi therefore completely bypases PageRank and advertisement content-delivery. Kagi has its own web index, ability to block sites, collects zero telemtric information, anonymizes search data and 
        has an ad-free business model.
