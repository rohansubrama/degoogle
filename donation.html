            <h2>Option 1: Buy Me A Coffee Button</h2> <img class="donationlogos" src="./00_buymeacoffeelogo.png">
        </div>
        <h3>Description</h3>    
        <p><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/">'Buy Me A Coffee'</a> is a method for fans, customers and supporters of creator work to show their appreciation by tipping some amount of money
            to the creator. Supporters can make a one-time contribution or sign up to contribute support on a monthly basis. This service doesn't require
            any investment for the creator and 'Buy Me A Coffee' only takes a commission of 5% from the total contribution amount. 
        </p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>    
        <ul>
            <li>Buy Me A Coffee is a wonderful mechanism to allow one-time donations without having to reveal sensitive credentials like Venmo accounts. Buy Me A Coffee 
            acts as the secure intermediary between the supporter and the creator, allowing anonymity if required.</li>
            <li>Supporters are re-directed to the website page on Buy Me A Coffee, so for the creator, only a linking button is required. No other technical embedding is necessary</li>
            <li>Once redirected to Buy Me A Coffee, supporters can use their credit card, debit card, Paypal account, or even Apple Pay to make a donation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy Me A Coffee is a very independent project and it is hard for patron to view a creator seriously when they see a link to a Buy Me A Coffee donation link.</li>
            <li>Supporters might not be familiar with it and be suspicious of such a donation link.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Option 2: Wordpress Charitable Plugin</h2> <img class="donationlogos" src="./00_charitablelogo.jpg">
        </div>
        <h3>Description</h3>    
        <p><a href="https://www.wpcharitable.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgoSm1v2iigMVDVpHAR20ugX_EAAYASAAEgJQUvD_BwE">'Charitable'</a> is a Wordpress plugin that allows creators to easily design a donation box and embed into self-hosted webpages or webpages made using wordpress.com. It integrates
            directly into the website and provides a secure gateway for supporters to fund creator work. It's free to use!
        </p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With WordPress being one of the primary options of hosting the project, a free-to-use extension is of great benefit.</li>
            <li>Charitable manages everything including secure gateway transcations, donor management, and integration with CRM.</li>
            <li>Users can make a payment using their credit or debit card, Paypal account or Apple Pay.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>  
        <ul>
            <li>For a project that is so anti-institutional, a donation embed that represents an institutional presence can possibly hinder from the proper visibility 
                    of the project.</li>
            <li>It is only compatible with WordPress and therefore flexibility in the completion of the site and choose of hosting service might be lost.</li>
            <li>Charitable might cost up to $69.00, so a 501(C) registration is required to be free.</li>
        </ul>
