     <h3> 
     Why I am De-Googling
     </h3>
     <p>
       I began the process of de-googling my life in 2023. 
       This process was in response to a more conscious understanding
        of how my information is being used (or misused). To take agency of my own information, I decided to find alternatives to Google for my everyday internet needs.
       <br>
       <br>
      A little more about me: I'm a filmmaker, sound designer, audiovisual enthusiast who is now pursuing a degree in Library Sciences. I am passionate about digital and technical literacy, with a focus on agency and self-determination. 
       <br>
       <br>
       De-googling is an active and conscious process. I acknolwedge that this is not possible for everybody. From institutional emails, to rigorously embeded practices, to paid features like Drive Storage and Google One, not everybody wishes to De-Google. However, I urge you to consider two of Google's most ubiquitous services - Google Chrome and Google Search. Combined, they form one of the most rigorous data collection practices that will be a more accessible for you to start with.

    <h3>De-Googling Ranking Scale</h3>
        <div class="warningdiv">
            <p class ="degooglewarning">
                This scale is in no way an authoritative measurement or even intended to measure de-googling. It's a 
                lighthearted tool to situate yourself and move towards the next step of de-googling. The levels are not 
                rigid, you can be flexibly traversing the scale at your own pace. I identify myself at level 6 but understand 
                that sometimes all I need is some YouTube content. Finally, level 10 is unhealthy, I strongly recommend
                stopping at 9. This scale has been developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanpm2001/DeGoogle-Ranking-Scale">'seanpm2001'</a> on GitHub. I have just tweaked the colors to 
                make them more appealing.
