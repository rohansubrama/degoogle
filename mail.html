<h3>You Got Better mail!</h3> 
<p> GMail is one of the most famous mail services in the world with over 1.8 billion users worldwide.
    Before 2017, GMail used to scan user emails for advertizing reasons. Even if they don't engage in this 
    practice, there are numerous concerns with having a GMail account.

            <p>Unlike most privacy focused email services, GMail is not inherently end-to-end encrypted.
                It uses the TLS (Transport Layer Security), only when the reciever also has TLS security enabled.

           <p>Even if GMail doesn't use email data to sells ads to its users, it still scans

            huge amount of data that Google has available on its users.

           <p>With mass surviellance becoming a universal problem, government agencies like ICE have

            Tuta Mail is an end-to-end encrypted mail service. Tuta has started using post-quantum
            cryptography, replacing standard encryption methods. Tuta, after its' employees participated
            in Fridays For Future protests, moved towards 100% renewable energy for its servers, along with a 
            strong committment to the environment. Tuta also provides protection against spam, phishing 
            and tracking. Tuta aims to provide an ethical alternative to surveillance capitalism, 
            where employees are paid a fair and transparent salary, uses 100% renewable energy, and focuses
            on user privacy over profit maximisation.

    no backdoors or government shadow access. Mailfence doesn't track or solitic ads to its users 
and protects against spam and phishing. As part of its committment to transparency, it provides 
Warrant Canary and Transparency Reports, thus making it clear to everybody when and why legal requests for user
information were made, which requests were denied by Mailfence, and which warrants were within the law and Mailfence
had to comply.  </p>
