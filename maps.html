<div class="reason"> 
<h3>This is a tough one.</h3> 
<p> Google Maps are amazing. That's the problem. Most alternatives do not match upto the convenience that 
  Google Maps offer. It also makes sense why - Google is a behemoth with resources to map
  the entire world, more accurately and more efficiently than everybody. It has truckloads of information on its users
  to improve and associate map searches to people's likes, behaviors, and patterns.
  Google Maps provides real-time traffic updates, transit information, provides street views and satellite views via Google Earth. 
  But, then why are Google Maps being denounced? <br>

     <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel0" aria-labelledby="tab0" role="tabpanel">
         <p>All maps services collate official government data, including Census information, 
            National GeoSpatial Agency data, OpenStreetMap data. Giants within the mapping services, Google and Apple, 
            are able to increase data accuracy using Satellite imagery, LiDAR scanning and aerial imagery. 
            Publicly available and official data is collated by user-locational and GPS data to make the experience for users
            very efficient. Google has a significant edge in mapping services because of its massive data collection practices prevalant 
            within all other Google services that can be further augmented to make the mapping experience personalized, efficient and satisfactory 
            for the user.

    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel1" aria-labelledby="tab1" role="tabpanel">
        <p>If you've ever looked at your 'Timeline' on Google Maps, you'd know the massive history of 
            locational data that Google has on you. This data represents trends within user movement that 
        integrates to the 'profile' that Google on it's users. Simultaneously, trends and engagement data
    from other Google services integrates to improve the functionality of Google maps. 
    As a rudimentary example, Google has a concrete idea where it's users work or go to school, what route they take, 
what transit they take, where they stop on the way, what restaurants they visit around their home. Google can then use some of this data to 
provide targeted ads that might entice a user to stop at a Dunkin Donuts on their way to work. </p>

    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel2" aria-labelledby="tab2" role="tabpanel">
        <p> I believe that Google probably has stronger demographic data on its users than the census is able 
            to collect. The idea that a private company is able to capture, map and analyze the freedom of movement 
            of its users and extrapolate it to direct sponsorships and advertisements to its users while making a massive profit
            is inherently problematic. Google's entire value proposition is to give people what they want. It's not an objective mapping service.

        <h3>4. Google Maps is not objective truth.</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="collapsing-section" id="panel3" aria-labelledby="tab3" role="tabpanel">
        <p> Maps, historically, are tools of power that determine the dominant ideologies and propagate
            the authority of those ideologies for personal interest. Google Maps is laiden with a focus on Western 
            cartographic theories and it's dangerous for an advertising company to hold world-dominance in digital 
            mapping. The idea of the objective 'truth' the Google Maps has within popular perception is in-fact 
            an exercize by a company monopolizing the digital mapping venture, under the guise of a free objective service.
        One very telling component of the Westernization of global mapping is Google Maps use of Western cultural symbols globally. 
        As an example it is ridiculous that a knife and fork represents all restaurants all over the world, even when those 
        restaurants might not ever had a knife or fork even present within the restaurant. Another very telling example is 
    that Palestine is never visibly shown as a word on Google Maps and the entire region is defacto titled as Israel.      </p>

        Apple Maps is one of the most famous alternative to Google. It is installed by default on 
        Apple products and is very competent. It provide similar features like Google, including 
        real-time traffice, transit data and bird's eye view functionality. While Google Maps is dominating 
        the market, Apple maps comes out ahead in security and privacy. As said by Apple's website -
        "Show you around without following you around." Apple Maps also doesn't engage in tracking for 
        adverisement purposes.

        OsmAnd is a privacy focused alternative to Google Maps. While it lacks in certain functionality, 
        it leads the maps industry in providing privacy and accountability. OsmAnd is based on OpenStreetMaps
        and is able to provide a helpful UI, wonderful advanced search features and offline mapping capabilites. 
        OsmAnd is not equipped with real-time transit data, unfortunately, but it can help provide
        an overview of the transit options available.

        HERE WeGo is a privacy focused mapping service that claims it prioritizes punctuality.
    It is able to provide a wonderful journey planner while offering security and flexibility. It has 
equivalent features as Google Maps, such as real-time traffic data, ETA calculations, multi-stop guidance
and it has the differentiating feature of offline capability too. Users can also make collections of mapping 
data to refer back to in the future. </p>

        OpenStreetMaps is a publicly contributed mapping service that is free to use by everybody. 
        Often, OpenStreetMaps serves as the architecture of independent mapping services. The best 
        feature of OpenStreetMap is the ability to use it offline. OpenStreetMaps focuses on local knowledge, 
        with its community-driven approach. Additionally, its open data and can be used by anybody.
